With RIGHT CLICK, you can mark the squares where you think there is a mine.
You have to LEFT CLICK ALL the squares that are not mines in order to win.
If you click a square where there is a mine, you lose.
The numbers that appear are the number of mines that are around that square.

A bomb number will appear on the bottom right of the screen for reference.,
